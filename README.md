# TurboChat
A chat client made in a Modded Scratch client that sends the messages to a webhook in a discord channel. Unfortunately the zipped file is over the 25 mb limit (HOW BRO FIX THIS) so I cannot upload it here. It is however in the linked Discord. It has support for:
Discord Webhook Integration
Custom .json Themes
Online Chat Regardless of whether or not Discord is linked or you have Discord. You don't even need a Discord account.
